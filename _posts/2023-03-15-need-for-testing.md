- Thoughts are like water. Once they stream down the creek, it takes years to change the path.
- Programmers do there work with their brains. We think, think, and think. 
- When we think in the wrong way, that is when the dangerous code is produced. 
- Test codes and manual testings may also be based on the wrong code.
  - This is a pitfall we never want to jump into. 
- Therefore, we need to always examine, is the code written based on logic and clear thoughts?
- Testing also makes work more efficient. Especially when we are refactoring. 
  - Refactoring is a horror without test codes.
