ChatGPT is really nice for generating shell commands. 
I guarantee in 10 years, people will depend on Mr. GPT for generating simple commands to enhance work speed. 
I also used ChatGPT to make a new command called `newpost {title}`.
This `newpost`command will generate a file named 'YYYY-MM-DD-{title}.md' inside my `_posts` directory. 
after the file has been created, by `echo` command, the script will automatically append jekyll boilerplates. 

### Step1 : Create `newpost.sh`

This is the shell script that ChatGPT generated for me.
`DATE` and `TITLE` will each be read from the system and command parameter. 

```
#!/bin/bash
cd "/Users/gahee/trinity-uba.github.io/_posts"
DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
TITLE="$1"
FILENAME="${DATE}-${TITLE}.md"
touch "$FILENAME"
echo -e "---\nlayout: post
        \ntitle: 
        \ndate:${DATE}
        \ncategories: jekyll update\n---" >> "$FILENAME"
cd - # move back to where you were 
```

### Step 2 : Move to bin directory 

```shell 
chmod +x newpost.sh

sudo mv newpost.sh /usr/local/bin/newpost
```
run above commands to make the file executable. Also move the file inside the bin directory to
use the command from any directory. 

### Step3: Test the Result 

```shell 
newpost "hello world"
```

Now, running the `newpost` command with title as first parameter will generate a file named `2023-03-01-hello world.md` 
inside `_posts` directory. Also, inside the file the jekyll boilerplate code ---layout:post...--- is written from the command. 


ChatGPT is a good booster for routine jobs like making files with certain names and contents. 
I feel liberated from all those confusing shell script jargon. Peace at last.
