- There are lots of ways for modeling a UI state.
- Granularity of a model should be determined by these criteria: 
  - Is it error prone? 
  - Is it hard to maintain? 
  - Is it hard for other programmers to understand? 
  - Does it result in subsequent unnecessary updates of non-changing values? 
  - Does it make sense? Does the structure of a model help maintain sensible business logic? 
  - Can you refer to the role of a model class from its properties & symbols? 
- Otherwise, you may result in properties jumping off everywhere or may encounter huge God model class that handles every state inside a screen. 
- When using data binding, it is very tempting to make a huge UI model and plug it inside the XML file. 
  - But this could result in violating above criteria. 
  - AND a lot of code reviews ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
- I have to go through lot of practice to properly extract a model class from a screen.
- Don't sacrifice maintainability over anything. (if possible.)
